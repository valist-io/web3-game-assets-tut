## Setting Up Your Project

Letâ€™s start by creating a new Unity project, weâ€™re going to use the Third Person starter project!

### Building for Web (WebGL)

To set up the default WebGL build, we will have to fix a few errors. Click player settings to view the **Player** section of the **Build Settings**.

Next click to expand the **Other Settings** section and uncheck **Auto Graphics API**.

Scroll down to the **Script Compilation** section click the **+** button and in the box put the text `STARTER_ASSETS_PACKAGES_CHECKED`. Then click apply, and exit the dialog; now you should be ready to build for the web

Now return to the build settings dialog and hit `Build and Run`.

Congratulations you just built a basic third-person game! ðŸ¥³
